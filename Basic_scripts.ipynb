I\\nn these \\nreact\\nor flow pattern is well defined\\n \\nw\\nhereas, \\nnon\\n-\\nideal\\n \\nreactors\\n \\nthe flow pattern can take \\nany particular shape in term like if you look at e curve\\n.\\n \\n \\nNow, \\nthis flow pattern tells you, \\nhow the\\n \\nflow is flowing inside a reactor\\n \\nor somehow \\nlike it \\ndoes not\\n \\nfollow a very particular or specific pattern\\n. N\\now, \\nin order to get a \\nconverse final aim\\n \\nis to have a reactor design. \\nAnd this reactor design somehow you \\nhave to incorporate this non\\n-\\nideality\\n. So\\n, I\\n \\ncannot\\n \\nassume any reactor to be plug flow \\nreactor or a \\nCSTR. So, \\nthey can be\\n \\nnon\\n-\\nideal flow patterns which will affect the rate\\n \\nreactor design\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 01:50)\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nin the last chapter will look at 0 dimensional model\\n \\nfor \\nnon\\n-\\nideal\\n \\nreactors\\n. So, \\nin this \\nyou have typical e curve\\n \\nright and this e curve \\nof course,\\n \\nis as you know\\n \\ne \\nis the exit age \\ndistribution\\n;\\n \\nthat means, \\nI\\n \\nhave a reactor this inlet going outlet\\n.\\n \\nA\\nnd what\\n \\nyou seeing in \\noutlet gives you, this particular pattern. N\\now, \\nthey can \\nbe\\n \\nmany different possibilities, \\nwhich of the flow patterns which would give raise to this e curve\\n. A\\nnd w\\nhat happens \\ninside a reactor is, \\nnot exactly reflected in the exit age distribution\\n \\nis something like that \\nwe already learned\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nso there are \\ndifferent possibilities\\n \\nin terms o\\nf what happens inside a reactor, \\nthe \\nmixing pattern inside a reactor\\n.\\n \\nSo, \\nmixing is\\n \\nnot \\nwell incorporated in the e curve\\n. So, \\nthen we looked at 2 different extremes\\n: s\\no\\n \\n1 extreme is a completes aggregati\\non model \\nand anothe\\nr extreme is\\n \\nthe maximum mixedness model. N\\now\\n \\nwhat let me quickly revise\\n, \\nso \\nit founds a nice platform of a further discussion as for is this chapter is concerned\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nlet me quickly revise\\n \\nwhat these 2 models are\\n, so \\nmaximum mixedness model means, \\nthat m\\nixing is maximum\\n. So, \\nmixing between what\\n? \\nSo, \\nif you look at this e curve there \\nare different segments\\n \\nevery segment\\n \\nright\\n. So, \\nthese segments whether will have will be \\nflowing through the\\n \\nevery seg\\nment will have a residence time. A\\nnd \\nthat is\\n \\nwhy like\\n \\nwil\\nl \\nhave a fluid element\\n, \\nwe will have a specific residence time and it is have a distribution \\nof residence time\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nwill have different segments spending different residence times in the reactor right \\nand the extent of in terms of a mass or volume of this\\n \\nparticular element spending this \\nmuch residence time the reactor\\n \\nthat may vary righ\\nt \\nt\\nhat is\\n \\nnothing but \\ne curve\\n. So, \\nyou \\nhave this different segments or different elements spending diff\\nerent residence time. \\nNow we talking about, \\na mixing between th\\nese 2 \\nelements \\nor\\n \\nseveral elements\\n. \\n \\nNow, there is\\n \\nan extreme where these elements then mix there well mix\\n \\nright\\n.\\n \\nA\\nnd there \\nis another extreme w\\nhere, \\nthese elements they \\ndo not\\n \\nmix\\n \\nat all\\n. So, \\nthey \\ngoing parallel\\n, \\nthey \\ndo not\\n \\ntalk to each other, \\nthey \\ndo not\\n \\ninteract with each other\\n. So, \\nthat is \\nsegregation; \\ncompletes segregation and there is another extreme where these are \\ncompletely mixed\\n. N\\now\\n, \\nhow it happens and all\\n \\nyou wi\\nll not going to look at a in detail\\n, \\nbut that is\\n \\na meaning of it\\n. Why we look at \\nthese extremes\\n, because \\nthese 2 extremes \\nwould \\ngive us a bound on conversion\\n.\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nit gives a range\\n \\ngiven an e curve like this\\n \\nI\\n \\nmake an assumption that is complete\\ns \\naggregation of these elements. \\nAnd\\n, then \\ncalculate a conversion and\\n, then \\nanother \\nextreme \\nwhere there mix\\n \\nthoroughly mix before the come out inside a reactor\\n. A\\nnd \\ncalculate a convergen\\nts\\n \\nand these 2 \\nconvergent\\ns\\n \\nare likely to be different and they are \\ngoing to different for most of the reactions\\n, but \\nthey are going to same for \\njust 1 case \\nrememb\\ner what i\\ns it, w\\nhen the reaction is fir\\nst order\\n.\\n \\n \\nA\\nnd I\\n \\nthink it has bee\\nn discussed to well before why first order reaction, \\ninternal mixing \\ndoes not\\n \\nmatter\\n \\nwhereas, \\nany other order\\n \\ninternal mixing matters a lot that\\n. So, \\nif you go \\nfor the complete\\n \\nsegregation mo\\ndel and maximum mixedness model. T\\nhese 2 models are \\ngoing to give you different \\nconvergents\\n, \\ndifferent\\n \\nextend of reactions\\n. I\\nntrinsic current is \\nsame\\n, \\nrest all volume\\n \\nthe reactor everything is same, \\ne curve is same\\n, but \\ninternal mixing \\nwill \\nmatter\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nwhat happen in this\\n \\ncase I\\n \\nam not goin\\ng to get a exact conversion why? Because, the \\n0 dimensional model I\\n \\nam just going to look at a extremes\\n.\\n \\nSo, \\nI\\n \\nget bounds\\n, I\\n \\nget a \\nrange\\n, \\nI \\nmay say that, \\nfine\\n \\nfor given volume this is the pos\\nsible range of\\n \\nconversion that I\\n \\nam likely to get if the e curve is like this for a \\nnon\\n-\\nideal\\n \\nreactor\\n. So, \\nit may vary from \\n0.45 to 0.5\\n5\\n,\\n \\ns\\no\\n \\nthat is\\n \\na idea I\\n \\nget \\nright I\\n \\ndo not\\n \\nget a exact conversion tha\\nt is a limitation \\nof this model. \\n \\nSo, t\\nhis is 0 dimensional model\\n \\nit talks about\\n, \\nthe extremes as for as a mixing inside a \\nreactor is concerned e curve only gives you partial information of the flow pattern it \\ndoes \\nnot\\n \\ntel\\nl you about a internal mixing. \\nA\\nnd for the fir\\nst order reaction \\nof course,\\n \\nit \\ndoes not\\n \\nmatter\\n. So, \\nit inside getting a bound\\n \\nand\\n \\nI just getting a single value I\\n \\ndo not\\n \\nhave to \\nworry about, \\nwhether it is complete segregation or whether it is maximum mixedness\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nthis is a quick revi\\nsion of what you learned before. A\\nnd now \\nlet us\\n, \\ngo ahead now \\nthis is \\na p\\nroblem with 0 dimensional model; \\nwhere it gives most of the times for \\nin non \\nfir\\nst order rea\\nction the range of convergen\\nt\\n. \\nB\\necause, \\nwe consider\\n \\n2 extremes we not\\n \\nlooking at what\\n \\nis\\n \\nhappening inside\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 08:37)\\n \\n \\nN\\now, \\nin this chapter we \\nare \\ngoin\\ng to look \\nat different models\\n: \\n1 of them is 1 parameter \\nmodel\\n. So, \\nI\\n \\nhave adsorption additional parameter \\nthat is\\n \\ngoing to give me some idea \\nabout\\n, \\nthe convergen\\nt\\n. I\\nt will help me get the exact value of convergen\\nt\\n \\nfor the given e \\ncurve\\n. Now, \\nremember that this model that we are going to discuss\\n \\nor other the 2 types of \\n1 para\\nmeter model we going to discuss\\n \\nt\\nhey app\\nlicable to particular geometry I\\n \\nwill \\nelaborate this point later\\n, but \\nremember that\\n. \\n \\nI\\nn 1 parameter model, \\nwe have 2 models that we\\n \\ngoing to discuss that \\nare\\n \\ntank in series\\n \\nand dispersion model\\n. N\\now \\nlet us\\n \\nconsider\\n \\na tube\\n \\nthat is\\n \\nwhy I\\n \\nsaid it is applicable \\nto a \\nparticular geometry. Again I\\n \\ntell you why am tell later tell just talk more on this a tube\\n \\nthis i\\ns flow that is taking place\\n. \\nA\\nnd you may have different extends of\\n \\nback mixing that \\nis occurring. N\\now, \\nif you are \\nvery flat profile what it means, \\nis a\\n \\nyou have a plug flow \\nreactor, \\nw\\nhat is a\\n \\ne curve that I am going to get i\\ns a direct delta function\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nthe e curve for the plug \\nflow reactor is direct delta function\\n, but \\nthis tube a reactor \\nthat I am talking about, \\nis not a plug flow reactor not necessaril\\ny behaving close to a \\nflow reactors. Y\\nou know\\n \\nnot a single real reactor is behaves like adsorption ideal \\nCSTR\\n \\nor \\nPFS\\n \\nit is clos\\ne to those reactors in extreme situations\\n.\\n \\nB\\nut they \\ndo not\\n \\nexactly follow \\nthe patterns that we assume\\n, but \\nanyway lie for if you are ve\\nr\\ny close to a plug flow \\nreactor, i\\nf you getting a e curve is matching with direct delta function\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nsome extend like a\\n \\nmake adsorption assumption that be behav\\ne like a plug flow \\nreactor and I\\n \\ncan design\\n \\na reactor accordingly. Considering, \\nsome possibility of\\n \\nconversion being plus minus\\n, but \\nthat is\\n \\nok\\n, because \\nby making assumption of plug flow \\nreactor it reduces the \\ncomplexity or legal in calculation i\\nt makes my calculations simpler; \\nit helps me to get some quick estimates of convergen\\nt\\n \\nfor a given volume or for given \\nconver\\ngen\\nt\\n \\nthe estimate for the volume. \\nSo, \\nlet me get back to this \\nyou have a tubular a \\nreactor in w\\nhich there is possibility of back mixing\\n;\\n \\nt\\nhat means\\n, \\nI \\nam not going to get \\nadsorption e curve which is similar to\\n \\ndirect delta \\nfunction or a plug flow reactor\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 11:46)\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nwhat is likely to happen s\\nee will have e curves e\\n \\nt\\n \\nversus\\n \\nt. \\nNow, \\nfor a plug flow \\nreactor I\\n \\nam going to get something like this\\n \\ninfinite right\\n \\nyou know\\n \\nthe meaning of it\\n. \\nA\\nnd this is\\n \\nnothing but \\ntau which is volume divided by volumetric flow rate \\nit is\\n \\nan ideal \\nsituation\\n. Now, \\nwhat I\\n \\nam going to see in the reality is somewhat like this\\n \\npossible I \\nmay \\nsee something like this\\n; I\\n \\nmay see something like this\\n \\nwhy does this happen? \\n \\nI\\nt happens\\n, because \\nthere is mixing in axial direction\\n, i\\nf there is no mixing I\\n \\nam going to \\nsee something lik\\ne this right\\n. B\\nut \\nbecause of mixing some fluid elements\\n \\nmay spend \\nmore time\\n, because \\nthey go back\\n \\nand then forth. \\nSo, \\nit possible that day spend more time \\nin a reactor\\n \\nand they come later; some \\nfluid elements \\nmay spend a less time just \\ncomp\\nonset\\n \\nfor those for gone a head or those lagging behind\\n. \\n \\nSo, it is\\n \\npossible that you get a distribution\\n \\nright\\n. So, \\n\\n \\nam talking about a tubular \\nreactor where there is possibility of back mixing\\n, \\nyou may have packing\\n \\nit may provide \\nsome\\n \\nbecause tutorcity a\\nnd all it\\n\\ns quite possible that you are you \\ndo not\\n \\nhave the \\nexactly \\nplug flow type behavior. N\\now\\n \\nso\\n \\nthese are\\n \\nthe different e curves how do I\\n \\ninterprets these \\ne curves and this is happ\\nen only because the back mixing\\n. \\nSo, I\\n \\nneed to a corporate effect \\nof back mixing in\\n \\nthis particular behavior that I\\n \\nhave observed all right\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 14:08\\n)\\n \\n \\n\\ns\\n \\nconsider any e curve\\n \\nrigh\\nt once this e curve is obtained, I have a tubular reactor \\nI\\n \\ndo a pulse injection experime\\nnt and look at \\nan\\n \\nexit age distribution\\n \\nI\\n \\nam going to see \\nthis\\n. Now, \\nthis is something given to you from this you ar\\ne going to come up with a \\nmodel\\n \\nI\\n \\nam goi\\nng to determine a parameter; now mixing is characterized, \\nby\\n \\nlike\\n \\nyou \\nhave a say \\nlet us\\n \\nhave a hypothetical mix\\nture or agitator in the reactor. \\n \\nSo, \\nin the tube itself I\\n \\ncan say that tube is\\n \\nconsisti\\nng of various compartments. I\\nf you \\nhave infinite such comportments in a given volume total v\\nolumes small small \\ncompartments. What\\n \\nis it mean? In\\nfinite it means that, \\nyou have flow similar to a plug \\nflow reactor\\n. \\nN\\now, \\nyou reduce a number of compartments what is it mean\\n? T\\nhat means, \\nthis some back mixing happening\\n \\nyou go on reducing, go on reducing; \\nmixing extend\\n \\nof \\nmixing\\n \\nwould increase right. Cons\\nider\\n \\nan extreme, \\nwhere you have just 1 compartment\\n \\nthere has to be compartment. \\n \\nSo, \\n1 compartment what is it mean? A\\n \\ncompartment with agitator good mixing complete \\nback mixing in that compartment what is it mean its \\nCSTR, t\\nhis is an another extreme\\n. \\nSo, \\nwhat is it \\nmean\\n?\\n \\nSo, \\nyou have on 1 side you have a \\nCSTR, \\non the other \\nside you have \\nP\\nFR; CSTR means\\n \\nare 1 compartment\\n, PFR means\\n \\nfinite compartments in between you \\nhave a reactor\\n \\nwhic\\nh has partial back mixing right\\n. \\n \\nSo \\nnow, \\nyou would have guess\\n \\nwhat is \\na \\nparameter that I am talking about, it is a number \\nof co\\nmpartments, e\\nvery compartment \\nis CSTR\\n \\nperfect back mixing right\\n. \\nSo, \\nits number \\nof \\nCSTR\\n \\nor number of tanks which are in series that are going to that number is going to\\n \\nbe a parameter for this model. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 17:03)\\n \\n \\nF\\nine\\n, so \\nwhy I\\n \\nam \\nsaying \\nit is\\n \\na tubular reactor\\n. \\nSo, let us\\n \\na consider reactor which \\nis a \\nvery regular geometry say I\\n \\nhave a\\n \\nreactor like this, t\\nhis is an inlet, \\noutlet. Now, \\nthere are \\nflow patterns\\n, then \\nthere \\nare \\npossibilities\\n \\nof some isolated zones right. \\nA\\nnd you have the \\noutput\\n \\nhere and what you going to see, \\nis a behavior like this any general e curve\\n. Now, \\nthis particular e curve\\n \\ndoes not\\n \\nlook like the e curve of it tubular reactor\\n \\nwhy. \\n \\nB\\necause, \\nfor tubular reactor like \\nlet us\\n, \\nlo\\nok at all the possibilities now, \\nyou have\\n \\na plug \\nflow reactor\\n, \\nCSTR\\n \\ne curve\\n \\nright \\nCSTR. O\\nnce \\nCSTR\\n \\nis this what will happen to 2 \\nCSTR\\n \\nlike a\\n \\nin the case of 2 \\nCSTR\\n \\nyou are g\\noing to get something like this. \\nT\\nhen 3 \\nCSTRs, \\n4 \\nC\\nSTRs\\n \\nsee\\n \\nwhat is happening now\\n? A\\ns you go on increasing number of \\nCSTRs\\n \\nyou are \\napproaching the plug flow reactor this is a \\nof course,\\n \\ngoing to infinity\\n \\nthis is b\\necoming \\nnarrow, i\\nt starts its seeing a delay here\\n. \\n \\nS\\no, \\nwhat is happening as we go on \\nincreasing the value of n\\n \\nthat is number of \\ncompartments, \\nnumber of \\nCSTRs\\n \\nin series\\n. T\\nhe behavior\\n \\nit goes it follows this particular \\nthe train goes from \\nCSTR\\n \\nto \\nPFR\\n, but \\nlook at these cu\\nrves the nature of these curves. \\nT\\nhese curves\\n \\na\\nnd to compare it compar\\ne these curves with this particular curve\\n \\nI \\nam \\ngetting a very irregular shape here or other very an unusual\\n \\nlike there are many \\npunctuations are up down and all that\\n. \\nW\\nh\\ny does that happen? I\\nt happens because of\\n \\nthe \\nregular geometry here and that define the\\n \\ngeometry flow pattern is a quite complex\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nthis flow pattern and this flow pattern they are not matching\\n. So, \\ncan I\\n \\napply a tank in \\nsize model for this reactor\\n? I\\n \\ncannot\\n \\ndo that\\n \\nWhy because\\n \\nthere is no curve that fits well \\nin this particular shape\\n. So, \\nagain 1 parameter model has \\nits\\n \\nown problems\\n, \\nit is \\napplicable to most \\nof the times to tubular reactor, \\nwhere the e curve is\\n \\nlike this or 1 of \\nthese rather. I\\nts continuous thing, it \\nis \\ncontinuous things, the no ups and downs, no \\nrecirculations or rec\\nycle with have\\n \\nbehavior. \\nSo I\\n \\nwil\\nl go back to my statements that, \\n1 \\nparameter models are good for tubular reactors where you get e curve with a nature like \\nthis\\n \\nclear\\n? \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 20:35)\\n \\n \\nSo, let us\\n \\ngo ahead and do some mathematical derivations\\n \\nho\\nw do a\\n \\nfind out number of \\ntanks that I\\n \\nhave in series fo\\nr a given tubular reactors say\\n \\nI\\n \\nhave\\n \\nan e curve\\n. H\\now do a \\nfind it\\n? \\nSo, let us\\n \\nderive an expression for t\\nhe e curve for a tank in series\\n \\ns\\nuppose I\\n \\nhave \\nn number of tanks in series\\n \\nlet us\\n \\ntry with 3 tanks in series fir\\nst. \\nA\\nnd\\n, then \\nexplain this \\nconcept to n times\\n, so \\nlet us\\n \\nhave 3 tanks in series\\n \\nfine\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nlet me write it write a let \\nexpression for\\n \\na e curve I mean I\\n \\nam going to give pulse \\nhere, \\nI\\n \\nam\\n \\ngoing to see what happens here\\n. So, \\nthis \\nis my e curve and this is what I\\n \\nam \\ngoing to get\\n \\nlikely to get\\n \\nfine. Now, \\ncan I\\n \\nget explanation for this\\n? B\\nut \\nI\\n \\nknow \\nCSTR \\nbehaves\\n. So, let us\\n \\nw\\nrite e\\n \\nt\\n \\ninto delta t this is a fra\\nction you know meaning of this I\\n \\nam \\nnot going to repeat\\n.\\n \\n \\nSo, \\ne delta t i\\ns a fraction that comes in between t and t plus delta t\\n \\nthat is equ\\nal to the \\nvolumetric flow rate I\\n \\nam going to \\nassume\\n \\nan volumetric flow rate remai\\nns constant \\nthroughout into c\\n3 t\\n. \\nSo t\\nhat means, \\nc\\n3 is a concentration that\\n \\nat the outlet of tank \\nnumber\\n \\n3\\n,\\n \\ns\\no\\n \\n1 2 and 3 right tank number 3 c3\\nt into delta t\\n \\ndivided by N0. What is N0? \\nN\\n0 is a total amount of pulse that have injected\\n. \\n \\nHow do a calculate N0? \\nN\\n0 is\\n \\nnothing but \\nbased on c3 t\\n, because \\nnow \\nI am get read of \\nN0 \\nI am \\njust looking at concentration outl\\net see and visualize\\n \\na rea\\nlize realistic \\nexperiment that I am doing\\n, \\nI\\n \\nam looking at a concentration at outlet\\n. So, \\ntank expires \\neverything in terms of concentrati\\non at outlet. Now, N\\n0 is a total amount of pulse or \\nother the tracer rather that have injecte\\nd\\n. N\\n0 is equal to\\n \\n0 to infinity c\\n3 is\\n \\nt dt \\ntotal \\namount that is come out\\n \\ninto\\n \\nof course,\\n \\nthe volumetric flow rate see, \\nconcentration right \\nconcentration into volumetric flow rate into time\\n.\\n \\nSo, I just integrate right I\\n \\njust integrate \\nfrom 0 to infinity\\n. So, \\nthat much amount have injected as tracer\\n, so \\nlet becomes N\\n0\\n, so \\nlet us go ahead fine. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 23:40)\\n \\n \\nL\\net me substitute\\n \\nfor N\\n0\\n, so \\nwh\\nat I get is e t is equal to v C\\n3 t\\n \\nright it says\\n \\nthis is delta t\\n. \\nSo, \\ne t is equal to c\\n3 t divided by\\n \\ns\\no\\n \\nI\\n \\nhave got a patience for e t\\n \\nbased on the \\nconcentra\\ntion at the outlet. Now, \\nthe c3 I\\n \\nneed to get that in terms of \\nthe residence time, \\ninitial concent\\nration or inlet concentration. \\nAnd I know\\n \\nthese are all \\nCSTR\\n, let me write\\n \\nan steady state balance for \\nCSTR. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 24:47)\\n \\n \\nCSTR \\n1 V\\n1 \\nthat is\\n \\na volume of \\nCSTR d c\\n1 by d\\nt you\\n \\nlearned this unsteady state balance \\nfor \\nCSTR\\n \\nis\\n \\neq\\nual to minus v C\\n1 right. S\\nhall I\\n \\nwrite here? T\\nhis is what this is going out\\n \\nthis is going out, \\nthis i\\ns accumulation coming in \\nS\\nhall I\\n \\nwrite this\\n? No, \\nbecause what I\\n \\nam looking at see\\n \\ntraces experiment, \\npulse experiments\\n, \\nI\\n \\nam injectin\\ng a tracer. And\\n, \\nthen \\nafter that at 0 time an i\\nnjecting tracer and after then I\\n \\nam observing the response\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nafter that \\nis there anything that is coming in as per as a tracer is concerned no right\\n. \\nSo, \\nI\\n \\nhave injected and stopped it\\n \\nnow \\nit is\\n \\nonly the inle\\nt that is flowing, the solvent that \\nis flowing. The tracer is not coming in, \\naft\\ner 0 plus and this is equation I\\n \\nhave written is \\nfor time 0 plus onwards let me 0 onwards\\n. So, \\nthis term is not there, \\nthis term\\n \\nis not \\nthere\\n.\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nI\\n \\nhave only this equation for the\\n \\nconcentration in the fir\\nst t\\nime I\\n \\nam writing it for a \\nfir\\nst \\ntime. Now, \\nlater on I\\n \\nwill do it first, second\\n, \\nthir\\nd and then \\nfinally, \\nI will get \\nexpressions for c\\n3 that is my objective\\n. So, \\nhere from this I\\n \\nget a concentrat\\nion and outlet \\nof tank 1, \\nwhere I\\n \\nhave the boundary condition at time is equal to 0\\n \\ntime is equal to 0 C1 \\nis equal to C\\n0\\n, but \\nsolve this equa\\ntion its very simple right\\n.\\n \\n \\nSo \\nthat is\\n \\nnothing but \\nC\\n1 is equal to c\\n0 e raise to\\n \\nminus t by tau 1 what is tau 1? \\ntau 1 is\\n \\nequal to v1 divided by v. This is a volumetric flow rate, this is a volume of fir\\nst tank\\n \\nthis \\nis a expression for\\n \\nC\\n1 that is the conce\\nntration and outlet of first tank.\\n \\nSo, let us\\n \\ncontinue \\nnow\\n, so \\nthis acts as a inlet for a seco\\nnd tank\\n. So, let us a write an expression for the \\nseco\\nnd tank\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 27:24)\\n \\n \\nT\\nank number 2\\n \\nwhat is it\\n? \\nv2 d c\\n2\\n \\nby d\\nt is equal to\\n \\nv C\\n1 coming in\\n \\nminus v c2 I\\n \\ncannot\\n \\nneglect this\\n. T\\nhis is changing with respect to time\\n \\na\\nnd 0\\n \\nplus C\\n1 will have some value\\n. \\nSo, \\nthere will be 2 terms as per as tank 2 is concerned\\n, but \\ntank 1 inlet was 0\\n, because \\ntr\\nacer was 0 at tank 0 plus right. Before we go ahead let m\\ne, make an assumption that v1 \\nis equal to v2 is equal to v\\n3\\n \\n\\ns are equal same V\\n \\nj\\nust was simplicity \\nright. \\n \\nL\\net me say vi\\n, because \\nI\\n \\nam not use v\\n \\nfor something and hence later I\\n \\nam not use v for \\nthe tot\\nal volume let me call this is v\\ni\\n. So, \\nlet becomes\\n \\nv\\ni here\\n \\nfine\\n, so \\nlet me simplify or\\n \\nother solve this further for C\\n1 I\\n \\nhave the expression. What is that? T\\nhis 1\\n. So, \\nthis \\nexpression I \\nwill substitute for C\\n1 what \\nI get is this d\\nc\\n2 by dt is plus c2 by now I \\nwill \\nsay\\n, tau i. W\\nhy tau i\\n.? \\nSo, \\nwhat is tau i? \\ntau i is equal to Vi divided by \\nv which is \\nconstant that is volumetric flow rate given to you\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nC\\n2\\n \\ndivided by tau i is equal t\\no C\\n0 divided by tau i int\\no e raise to minus t by ta\\nu i I am \\njust substituting for C\\n1 a\\nnd expressing everything in terms of tau\\n \\ni now\\n. So, \\nyou know \\nwhat is tau i\\n? \\nSo, \\nI\\n \\nget \\nan\\n \\nexpression \\nfor differential equation for C\\n2 right now again, for \\nthis I\\n \\nneed a boundary\\n \\ncondition at t is equal to 0, C\\n2 is equal to 0 right\\n. So, \\nthis equation\\n \\nI\\n \\nsolve this using\\n \\nthis boundary condition\\n, so \\nthis is famous or this is a couple of method \\nof integrations factor\\n \\ne raise to t by tau i. So, \\nthis expression can be \\nsolving\\n \\nusing \\nintegration factor or integrating factor\\n \\ne base to tau by\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 30:26)\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nt by tau i\\n \\nand I get the solution for it; \\nwhich is give\\nn by C\\n2\\n \\nis equal to C\\n0 t divided \\nby t tau i i\\nnto e raise to minus t by tau i. S\\nee c\\noncentration and outlet of the seco\\nnd tank \\nis a express in terms of ini\\ntial concentration time anyway, \\nI\\n \\nwant to know how it changes \\nwith time and \\nof course,\\n \\ntau i right. \\nI\\n \\nwill\\n \\neliminated C\\n1\\n \\nwhat is my aim? \\nI\\n \\nam my \\naim is \\nto get C3 in terms of C\\n0 t and tau i\\n. \\n \\nSo, let us\\n \\ndo it now\\n \\nI\\n \\nfollow same methodol\\nogy for tank 3 substitute for C\\n2\\n, because \\nnow \\nin tank 3\\n \\nin inlet is C\\n2 right and I\\n \\nwill solve this equation fine\\n. So, \\nwhat I get is, \\nC\\n3 is \\nequal to\\n, so \\nyou can try it out\\n \\nagain a same methodology\\n \\nI get what I\\n \\nget is this\\n \\ne raise to \\nminus t by tau i\\n. So, \\nyou have 2 appearin\\ng here right see the difference, \\nnot m\\nuch \\ndifference\\n \\nbut of course,\\n \\nyou have the you have the exponential term there\\n.\\n \\nAnd\\n, but \\ninstead of t now it becomes t square i have 2 appea\\nring here tau instead of tau i I\\n \\nhave\\n \\ntau \\ni square\\n.\\n \\nSo, let us\\n \\ngo ahead\\n \\nnow I\\n \\nhave the expression for the e curve or other the e for \\nthe enti\\nre reactor that tanks in series. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(Refer Slide Time: 32:21)\\n \\n \\nW\\nhat is that\\n? T\\nhis 1\\n \\nn\\now I\\n \\nhave the expression for e, \\nI have the expression for C\\n3; \\nsubstitute this C\\n3 in e curve or other the\\n \\ne expression for e\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 32:40)\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nwhat\\n \\nI\\n \\nget is see final\\n, so \\nsee\\n \\nobjective is to get\\n \\ne expression for e\\n. So, I substitute for \\nC\\n3\\n \\nand let me write this fir\\nst\\n, so \\nthat\\n \\nC\\n3\\n \\nright. \\nN\\now, \\nwhat is this\\n? T\\nhis is the total amount \\nof the\\n \\ntracer that I\\n \\nhave injected\\n, \\ncan I\\n \\nget it in t\\nerms of initial concentration C0? Possib\\nle\\n \\nwhat is it\\n? \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 33:44)\\n \\n \\nIf\\n \\nyou look at it wh\\nat happens at time 0 you have C\\n0 is equal to \\nN0; \\nthat is a total number \\nof moles or whatever\\n \\nunit can be \\ngrams or moles whatever\\n. Y\\nou have that muc\\nh amount \\nof tracer divided by V\\n1\\n.\\n \\nSo, \\nthis is something present at time\\n \\nis equal to 0 sharp\\n \\nin the \\nreactor\\n \\nV1 is a volume and it can be Vi\\n \\nalso in our case\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nlet me call this is V\\ni; \\nwhich is\\n \\nnothing but \\nthe \\ntotal amount right is V\\n0 which is\\n \\nnothing but \\nv\\n \\nrather\\n \\ninto\\n \\nC\\n3 t d\\nt right\\n \\ndivided by V\\ni\\n. So, \\nfrom this\\n \\nwhat is this v by V\\ni tau \\n1 by tau\\n. So, \\nthis till is tell me that this integration is\\n \\nnothing but \\ntau i into C\\n0\\n \\nright\\n.\\n \\nA\\nnd \\nI\\n \\nam just expressing it in term\\ns o\\nf initial concentration\\n, because \\nthis is appearing the final \\nequation right\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 35:27)\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nlet me\\n \\nget back to this equation\\n \\nthis is for the e curve I am substituting for C3 that I\\n \\nhave just derived\\n \\nC\\n3 that have derived here\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer \\nSlide Time: 35:39)\\n \\n \\nI\\n \\nwi\\nll substitute it here and then I\\n \\nwill have a very simple equation\\n \\ne t\\n \\nis equal to\\n \\nC0 C\\n0 \\nwill get cancel\\n. \\nA\\nnd I\\n \\nwill have t square\\n \\ndivided by 2 tau i\\n \\nnow it cubed\\n, because \\nit is\\n \\n1 \\ntau I\\n \\nhave just come from that denominator integration term\\n \\ne raise to minus t by tau i\\n. \\nN\\now, \\nthis is for 3 tanks\\n \\nif you a\\npplies same logic do it 4 tanks, 5 tanks, 6 tanks, n tanks \\nthen wh\\nat I am going to get is this is\\n \\nfor n tanks\\n \\nis t raise to see 3 tanks 2 h\\nere n minus 1 \\ndivided by see n minus 1 factorial into tau \\ni raise to n see the logic\\n, then \\ne raise to minus \\nt by tau i this is for n tanks\\n \\nin series\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nI\\n \\nhave got an expression\\n \\nfo\\nr e curve for n tanks in series; \\na general expression for e \\ncurve for the \\nn tanks in series\\n \\na\\nnd that is what I\\n \\nwant right\\n. So, \\nwhen I\\n \\nget e curve\\n \\nI\\n \\nhave \\ne curve\\n, so \\nin this\\n \\nis 1 parameter that is n that I\\n \\ncan calculate from this\\n. So, \\nthis will\\n \\nthis \\nwill obtain from experiment in the laboratory fo\\nr a reactor; \\nit tabular reactor \\nunder a flow \\nconditions that are desired for the reaction\\n. B\\nut of course,\\n \\nI\\n \\ndo the experiment\\n \\nnonreactive condition you know that just look at a\\n \\nresidence time distribution right\\n.\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nfrom this experiment I\\n \\nget e curve from e\\n \\ncurve I get n\\n, because \\nI had \\nI\\n \\nhave an \\nexpression for tanks in series e c\\nurve and once again get n then I\\n \\ncan calculate a \\nconversion\\n. What is n? \\nn tells you the extent of back mixing n infinity means\\n, \\nif \\nPFR, \\nn\\n1 \\nmeans its \\nCSTR. A\\nnd in between 1 and infinity you have the extent of back\\n \\nmixing \\ncharacterized by the number n\\n \\nfine. L\\n\\n \\ngo ahead and simplified further\\n \\nequation looks \\nbit a complicated\\n.\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nfrom this you have going to defining a term called a variance \\nof course,\\n \\nyou know \\nwhat is variance when we had distribution the varianc\\ne\\n \\nthat means, \\nhow much at \\nparticular time in the values of away from the average\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 38:44)\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nthe something called as variance before that will define a term \\nnon\\n-\\ndimensional\\n \\nterm \\ntheta equal to t by\\n \\ntau, w\\nhere tau is that total \\nresidence time\\n \\nwhat is it mean\\n? T\\nhat means, \\ntau is \\nn into tau i is individual residence time for every tank n into ta\\nu i is a total \\nresidence time\\n.\\n \\nSo, \\nif tau i is equal to V\\ni by v then tau is equal to V\\n \\nwhich is\\n \\nnothing but \\nV1 plus V\\n2 and\\n \\nso\\n \\non divided by\\n \\nV\\n \\nt\\nhat why I said now I\\n \\nhave been using V\\n \\nfor \\nsomething else the total volume\\n. \\n \\nWhy? Because see I\\n \\ndo not\\n \\nhave tanks, I\\n \\nam just assuming a tubular reactor to be set of \\ntanks\\n. So, \\nall I\\n \\nknow is the total volume right\\n, so \\nI\\n \\nneed to expression in terms of total \\nvolume \\nfinally, \\nright this total volume is V\\n1 plus \\nV2 plus V\\n3 plus\\n \\nV\\n4 and\\n \\nso \\non\\n.\\n \\nSo, \\nthe \\nresidence time based on total volume\\n \\nis tau right for individual reactor is what tau i\\n \\nnow \\nit i\\ns tau. And\\n, then \\nI\\n \\nhave a dimensio\\nn less number theta express in terms of tau that is t \\nby tau\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nI have the expression for e t I\\n \\nwill write it again to raise to n minus 1 divided by n \\nminus 1 factorial tau i n right e raise t\\no minus t by tau i. Now, \\nthis will get reduce to e \\ntheta\\n \\nnow \\nt will be express in terms of dimension les\\ns time theta while do that\\n, then \\nall \\nthese will get converted to n into n theta raise to n minus 1 see t will become\\n \\nn theta\\n.\\n \\nB\\necause, \\nsee t right then e raise to minus n theta\\n \\ndivided by n minus 1 factorial\\n. So, \\nthis \\nis the expression for e in terms of dimensional less time instead of actual time\\n \\ny\\nou going \\nto use this further\\n \\nt\\nhat why you expressed like that. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 41:50)\\n \\n \\nNow, \\nthere is a variance that we define now how do we define variance if you \\nhave a \\ndistribution the\\n \\nexpression for the variance is, \\nin terms of dimensional less time\\n \\nvariance \\nsquare\\n \\nis equal to actual\\n \\nvariance in time divided by tau square\\n. N\\now\\n, \\nso \\nthis is\\n \\nnothing \\nbut \\n0 to infinity theta minus 1 square e theta d theta\\n \\nright\\n. I\\n \\nhop\\ne it is clear if you write \\njust variance in time you will have t minus tau\\n \\nyou have to just divided by tau square\\n \\nand \\nthen you get this. \\n \\nSo, i\\nt is\\n \\na very as I\\n \\nsaid like how\\n \\nmuch you go away from tau mean \\nresidence time\\n. So, \\nif \\nyou expand this further\\n \\nwhat\\n \\nyou get is\\n \\n0 to infinity\\n \\ntheta square e theta d theta minus 2\\n. I\\n \\nam just expanding this\\n, so \\ntheta minus 2 theta plus 1\\n \\nso \\nyou get this\\n. \\nSo, \\nwhat is the value \\nof this? T\\nhis is equal to 1 this particular\\n \\nterm. What about this? T\\nhis particular term this \\nis d\\nimensionless average residence time dimensionless\\n. \\n \\nSo, it is\\n \\ngoing to be 1 because it is the reference is tau\\n \\nfor the residence time\\n \\nit was t e t \\nd\\nt\\n, then \\nI\\n \\nwas tau now it is theta e theta d theta\\n; that means, \\nit is tau divided by tau\\n \\nthat \\nmeans, \\n1\\n. So, \\nthis is this is going to be\\n \\nagain is integration\\n \\nis going to be 1, t\\nhis is 1, \\nthis \\nis 1\\n. So, \\nminus 2 plus 1 is minus 1\\n \\n0 theta\\n \\nminus 1\\n, so \\nthis is \\nan\\n \\nexpression\\n \\nI\\n \\nam going to \\nsimplify this further\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 44:45)\\n \\n \\nSo, let us\\n \\nsolve this integration \\nwhat I\\n \\nget is or before that let me just write it again\\n \\nright\\n \\nsubstitute for e theta see we have\\n \\nderived equation for e theta\\n. So, \\nthis is e theta\\n \\nI\\n \\njust \\nsubstitute for it\\n \\nn n theta n minus 1\\n \\ndivided by n minus 1 factorial\\n \\ne raise t\\no minus n theta \\nd theta minus 1\\n. N\\now, \\nif you do all this what you get is\\n, because \\ntake n\\n, so \\nwill have n \\nraise to n divided by n minu\\ns 1 factorial it come out right. A\\nnd you have 0 infinity theta \\nraise to n plus 1 e raise to minus n theta\\n \\nright d\\nt\\n \\nthat is \\nsolve this further what you get, \\nyou can do it on your own\\n.\\n \\n \\nSo, \\nit get simplified to very simple term 1 by n\\n \\nand this is what I\\n \\nwant\\n \\nvariance is 1 by n; \\nv\\nariance is obtained from the e curve\\n. So, \\nonce you get variance right you get value of\\n \\nand number of \\ntanks in series\\n. So, \\nn is equal to 1 by\\n \\nsigma theta square which is\\n \\nnothing \\nbut \\ntau square divided by sigma square\\n \\nright\\n. So, \\nI get a value of n this is what I\\n \\nwant \\nright\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\ngiven e curve now will see how t\\no calculate sigma from e curve, I\\n \\nhave already \\ntold \\nyou that expression for\\n \\nrate\\n. B\\nut \\nwill solve or I\\n \\nwill tell you the procedure to get sigma\\n \\nfrom that\\n \\nor this sigma they from that I \\nget n\\n.\\n \\nSo, \\ne curve will give you sigma and sigma \\nwill give you the value of n right\\n. \\n \\n(\\nRefer Slide Time: 47:23)\\n \\n \\nHow\\n \\nto calculate\\n \\nconversion\\n \\nf\\nor the given\\n \\nn, now\\n \\nwe t\\nalking about reactor tank in series \\nt\\nhere is\\n \\nvery simple know\\n. I have n number of tanks how do I\\n \\ncalculate conversion for a \\nCSTR? I\\n \\nhave n number of \\nCSTR\\n \\nare in\\n \\nseries the conversion say for fir\\nst order rea\\nction\\n \\nthe conversion is 1 minus 1 by 1 plus tau i k raise to n\\n \\ntau i is the again see \\ndo not\\n \\nget \\nconfusion\\n \\nthis 2 tau. \\n \\nSo, this\\n \\n2 tau is the residence time for single tank\\n \\nwhat is k? \\nk is the rate constant\\n.\\n \\nA\\nnd \\nthis is something like that you done before\\n.\\n \\nSo, \\nlet me summarize I have a tubular reactor \\nI\\n \\nwant to get a convergen\\nt\\n \\nproblem can be o\\nther around for given convergen\\nt\\n, \\nfind out a \\nlength a volume the tubular reactor\\n, w\\nhen I\\n \\nhave a tubular reactor\\n \\nlet us\\n \\ntalk about\\n \\ngiven \\nreactor in calculating \\nconvergen\\nt\\n. \\n \\nSo, \\nI\\n \\nha\\nve a tubular reactor what \\nI\\n \\nwill have to? I \\nwill not assume it has a \\nPFR\\n. Now we \\nhave talking about, \\nnon\\n-\\nideality\\n \\nthat can be possibility of back mixing\\n. So, \\nwhat\\n \\nI \\nwill do\\n \\nis I just pass of fluid I\\n \\nwill do residence time distribution \\nexperiment\\n.\\n \\nI\\n \\nwill inject a trac\\ner \\nlook at its falls it outlet I\\n \\nwill ge\\nt a e curve form it right. Once I\\n \\nhave the e curve\\n, then \\nI\\n \\ncan \\nget a variance from the e curve; \\nfrom the variance \\nI\\n \\nwill get a number of tanks in \\nseries for that particular tubular reactors reactor other if \\nit is\\n \\nclose to \\nPFR \\nthe value of n \\nwill be very large\\n. \\n \\nI\\nf there is\\n \\nso \\nmuch back mixing happening for some reasons value of n will be close to 1 \\n1 2 3 whatever\\n. So, \\nI get a value of n once I know the value of n, I\\n \\nhave the expression \\nfor convergen\\nt\\n \\nand that tells me how m\\nuch is the convergen\\nt\\n \\nbased on n.

       "'Chemical Reactions Engineering II\\nProf. Sanjay Mahajani\\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering\\nIndian Institute of Technology, Bombay\\n\\nLecture - 6\\nNon — ideal Reactors: Tank — in — serious model\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 00:27)\\n\\n \\n\\nWe are going to start a new chapter today which deals with design of non-ideal reactors.\\nSo, we going to look at reactor models for non-ideal reactors let us take, a review of what\\nwe have learnt so far as per as non-ideality in reactors is concerned as you know, there\\nare ideal reactors like: CSTR, PFR in which the flow pattern is well define. In these\\nreactor flow pattern is well defined whereas, non-ideal reactors the flow pattern can take\\n\\nany particular shape in term like if you look at e curve.\\n\\nNow, this flow pattern tells you, how the flow is flowing inside a reactor or somehow\\nlike it does not follow a very particular or specific pattern. Now, in order to get a\\nconverse final aim is to have a reactor design. And this reactor design somehow you\\nhave to incorporate this non-ideality. So, I cannot assume any reactor to be plug flow\\nreactor or a CSTR. So, they can be non-ideal flow patterns which will affect the rate\\n\\nreactor design.\\n\\x0c(Refer Slide Time: 01:50)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, in the last chapter will look at 0 dimensional model for non-ideal reactors. So, in this\\nyou have typical e curve right and this e curve of course, is as you know e is the exit age\\ndistribution; that means, I have a reactor this inlet going outlet. And what you seeing in\\noutlet gives you, this particular pattern. Now, they can be many different possibilities,\\nwhich of the flow patterns which would give raise to this e curve. And what happens\\ninside a reactor is, not exactly reflected in the exit age distribution is something like that\\n\\nwe already learned.\\n\\nSo, so there are different possibilities in terms of what happens inside a reactor, the\\nmixing pattern inside a reactor. So, mixing is not well incorporated in the e curve. So,\\nthen we looked at 2 different extremes: so 1 extreme is a completes aggregation model\\nand another extreme is the maximum mixedness model. Now what let me quickly revise,\\n\\nso it founds a nice platform of a further discussion as for is this chapter is concerned.\\n\\nSo, let me quickly revise what these 2 models are, so maximum mixedness model means,\\nthat mixing is maximum. So, mixing between what? So, if you look at this e curve there\\nare different segments every segment right. So, these segments whether will have will be\\nflowing through the every segment will have a residence time. And that is why like will\\nhave a fluid element, we will have a specific residence time and it is have a distribution\\n\\nof residence time.\\n\\x0cSo, will have different segments spending different residence times in the reactor right\\nand the extent of in terms of a mass or volume of this particular element spending this\\nmuch residence time the reactor that may vary right that is nothing but e curve. So, you\\nhave this different segments or different elements spending different residence time.\\n\\nNow we talking about, a mixing between these 2 elements or several elements.\\n\\nNow, there is an extreme where these elements then mix there well mix right. And there\\nis another extreme where, these elements they do not mix at all. So, they going parallel,\\nthey do not talk to each other, they do not interact with each other. So, that is\\nsegregation; completes segregation and there is another extreme where these are\\ncompletely mixed. Now, how it happens and all you will not going to look at a in detail,\\nbut that is a meaning of it. Why we look at these extremes, because these 2 extremes\\n\\nwould give us a bound on conversion.\\n\\nSo, it gives a range given an e curve like this I make an assumption that is completes\\naggregation of these elements. And, then calculate a conversion and, then another\\nextreme where there mix thoroughly mix before the come out inside a reactor. And\\ncalculate a convergents and these 2 convergents are likely to be different and they are\\ngoing to different for most of the reactions, but they are going to same for just 1 case\\n\\nremember what is it, when the reaction is first order.\\n\\nAnd I think it has been discussed to well before why first order reaction, internal mixing\\ndoes not matter whereas, any other order internal mixing matters a lot that. So, if you go\\nfor the complete segregation model and maximum mixedness model. These 2 models are\\ngoing to give you different convergents, different extend of reactions. Intrinsic current is\\nsame, rest all volume the reactor everything is same, e curve is same, but internal mixing\\n\\nwill matter.\\n\\nSo, what happen in this case I am not going to get a exact conversion why? Because, the\\n0 dimensional model I am just going to look at a extremes. So, I get bounds, I get a\\nrange, I may say that, fine for given volume this is the possible range of conversion that I\\nam likely to get if the e curve is like this for a non-ideal reactor. So, it may vary from\\n0.45 to 0.55, so that is a idea I get right I do not get a exact conversion that is a limitation\\n\\nof this model.\\n\\x0cSo, this is 0 dimensional model it talks about, the extremes as for as a mixing inside a\\nreactor is concerned e curve only gives you partial information of the flow pattern it does\\nnot tell you about a internal mixing. And for the first order reaction of course, it does not\\nmatter. So, it inside getting a bound and I just getting a single value I do not have to\\n\\nworry about, whether it is complete segregation or whether it is maximum mixedness.\\n\\nSo, this is a quick revision of what you learned before. And now let us, go ahead now\\nthis is a problem with 0 dimensional model; where it gives most of the times for in non\\nfirst order reaction the range of convergent. Because, we consider 2 extremes we not\\n\\nlooking at what is happening inside.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 08:37)\\n\\n \\n\\nNow, in this chapter we are going to look at different models: 1 of them is 1 parameter\\nmodel. So, I have adsorption additional parameter that is going to give me some idea\\nabout, the convergent. It will help me get the exact value of convergent for the given e\\ncurve. Now, remember that this model that we are going to discuss or other the 2 types of\\n1 parameter model we going to discuss they applicable to particular geometry I will\\n\\nelaborate this point later, but remember that.\\n\\nIn 1 parameter model, we have 2 models that we going to discuss that are tank in series\\nand dispersion model. Now let us consider a tube that is why I said it is applicable to a\\nparticular geometry. Again I tell you why am tell later tell just talk more on this a tube\\n\\nthis is flow that is taking place. And you may have different extends of back mixing that\\n\\x0cis occurring. Now, if you are very flat profile what it means, is a you have a plug flow\\n\\nreactor, what is a e curve that I am going to get is a direct delta function.\\n\\nSo, the e curve for the plug flow reactor is direct delta function, but this tube a reactor\\nthat I am talking about, is not a plug flow reactor not necessarily behaving close to a\\nflow reactors. You know not a single real reactor is behaves like adsorption ideal CSTR\\nor PFS it is close to those reactors in extreme situations. But they do not exactly follow\\nthe patterns that we assume, but anyway lie for if you are very close to a plug flow\\n\\nreactor, if you getting a e curve is matching with direct delta function.\\n\\nSo, some extend like a make adsorption assumption that be behave like a plug flow\\nreactor and I can design a reactor accordingly. Considering, some possibility of\\nconversion being plus minus, but that is ok, because by making assumption of plug flow\\nreactor it reduces the complexity or legal in calculation it makes my calculations simpler;\\nit helps me to get some quick estimates of convergent for a given volume or for given\\nconvergent the estimate for the volume. So, let me get back to this you have a tubular a\\nreactor in which there is possibility of back mixing; that means, I am not going to get\\n\\nadsorption e curve which is similar to direct delta function or a plug flow reactor.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 11:46)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, what is likely to happen see will have e curves e t versus t. Now, for a plug flow\\nreactor I am going to get something like this infinite right you know the meaning of it.\\n\\nAnd this is nothing but tau which is volume divided by volumetric flow rate it is an ideal\\n\\x0csituation. Now, what I am going to see in the reality is somewhat like this possible I may\\n\\nsee something like this; I may see something like this why does this happen?\\n\\nIt happens, because there is mixing in axial direction, if there is no mixing I am going to\\nsee something like this right. But because of mixing some fluid elements may spend\\nmore time, because they go back and then forth. So, it possible that day spend more time\\nin a reactor and they come later; some fluid elements may spend a less time just\\n\\ncomponset for those for gone a head or those lagging behind.\\n\\nSo, it is possible that you get a distribution right. So, it’s | am talking about a tubular\\nreactor where there is possibility of back mixing, you may have packing it may provide\\nsome because tutorcity and all it’s quite possible that you are you do not have the exactly\\nplug flow type behavior. Now so these are the different e curves how do | interprets these\\ne curves and this is happen only because the back mixing. So, I need to a corporate effect\\n\\nof back mixing in this particular behavior that I have observed all right.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 14:08)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, let’s consider any e curve right once this e curve is obtained, I have a tubular reactor\\nI do a pulse injection experiment and look at an exit age distribution I am going to see\\nthis. Now, this is something given to you from this you are going to come up with a\\nmodel I am going to determine a parameter; now mixing is characterized, by like you\\n\\nhave a say let us have a hypothetical mixture or agitator in the reactor.\\n\\x0cSo, in the tube itself I can say that tube is consisting of various compartments. If you\\nhave infinite such comportments in a given volume total volumes small small\\ncompartments. What is it mean? Infinite it means that, you have flow similar to a plug\\nflow reactor. Now, you reduce a number of compartments what is it mean? That means,\\nthis some back mixing happening you go on reducing, go on reducing; mixing extend of\\nmixing would increase right. Consider an extreme, where you have just 1 compartment\\n\\nthere has to be compartment.\\n\\nSo, 1 compartment what is it mean? A compartment with agitator good mixing complete\\nback mixing in that compartment what is it mean its CSTR, this is an another extreme.\\nSo, what is it mean? So, you have on 1 side you have a CSTR, on the other side you have\\nPFR; CSTR means are 1 compartment, PFR means finite compartments in between you\\n\\nhave a reactor which has partial back mixing right.\\n\\nSo now, you would have guess what is a parameter that I am talking about, it is a number\\nof compartments, every compartment is CSTR perfect back mixing right. So, its number\\nof CSTR or number of tanks which are in series that are going to that number is going to\\n\\nbe a parameter for this model.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 17:03)\\n\\n \\n\\nFine, so why I am saying it is a tubular reactor. So, let us a consider reactor which is a\\nvery regular geometry say I have a reactor like this, this is an inlet, outlet. Now, there are\\n\\nflow patterns, then there are possibilities of some isolated zones right. And you have the\\n\\x0coutput here and what you going to see, is a behavior like this any general e curve. Now,\\n\\nthis particular e curve does not look like the e curve of it tubular reactor why.\\n\\nBecause, for tubular reactor like let us, look at all the possibilities now, you have a plug\\nflow reactor, CSTR e curve right CSTR. Once CSTR is this what will happen to 2 CSTR\\nlike a in the case of 2 CSTR you are going to get something like this. Then 3 CSTRs, 4\\nCSTRs see what is happening now? As you go on increasing number of CSTRs you are\\napproaching the plug flow reactor this is a of course, going to infinity this is becoming\\n\\nnarrow, it starts its seeing a delay here.\\n\\nSo, what is happening as we go on increasing the value of n that is number of\\ncompartments, number of CSTRs in series. The behavior it goes it follows this particular\\nthe train goes from CSTR to PFR, but look at these curves the nature of these curves.\\nThese curves and to compare it compare these curves with this particular curve I am\\ngetting a very irregular shape here or other very an unusual like there are many\\npunctuations are up down and all that. Why does that happen? It happens because of the\\n\\nregular geometry here and that define the geometry flow pattern is a quite complex.\\n\\nSo, this flow pattern and this flow pattern they are not matching. So, can I apply a tank in\\nsize model for this reactor? I cannot do that Why because there is no curve that fits well\\nin this particular shape. So, again 1 parameter model has its own problems, it is\\napplicable to most of the times to tubular reactor, where the e curve is like this or 1 of\\nthese rather. Its continuous thing, it is continuous things, the no ups and downs, no\\nrecirculations or recycle with have behavior. So I will go back to my statements that, 1\\nparameter models are good for tubular reactors where you get e curve with a nature like\\n\\nthis clear?\\n\\x0c(Refer Slide Time: 20:35)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, let us go ahead and do some mathematical derivations how do a find out number of\\ntanks that I have in series for a given tubular reactors say I have an e curve. How do a\\nfind it? So, let us derive an expression for the e curve for a tank in series suppose I have\\nn number of tanks in series let us try with 3 tanks in series first. And, then explain this\\n\\nconcept to n times, so let us have 3 tanks in series fine.\\n\\nSo, let me write it write a let expression for a e curve I mean I am going to give pulse\\nhere, I am going to see what happens here. So, this is my e curve and this is what I am\\ngoing to get likely to get fine. Now, can I get explanation for this? But I know CSTR\\nbehaves. So, let us write e t into delta t this is a fraction you know meaning of this I am\\n\\nnot going to repeat.\\n\\nSo, e delta t is a fraction that comes in between t and t plus delta t that is equal to the\\nvolumetric flow rate I am going to assume an volumetric flow rate remains constant\\nthroughout into c3 t. So that means, c3 is a concentration that at the outlet of tank\\nnumber 3, so 1 2 and 3 right tank number 3 c3t into delta t divided by NO. What is NO?\\n\\nNO is a total amount of pulse that have injected.\\n\\nHow do a calculate NO? NO is nothing but based on c3 t, because now | am get read of\\nNO I am just looking at concentration outlet see and visualize a realize realistic\\nexperiment that I am doing, I am looking at a concentration at outlet. So, tank expires\\n\\neverything in terms of concentration at outlet. Now, NO is a total amount of pulse or\\n\\x0cother the tracer rather that have injected. NO is equal to 0 to infinity c3 is t dt total\\namount that is come out into of course, the volumetric flow rate see, concentration right\\nconcentration into volumetric flow rate into time. So, | just integrate right I just integrate\\nfrom 0 to infinity. So, that much amount have injected as tracer, so let becomes NO, so\\n\\nlet us go ahead fine.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 23:40)\\n\\n \\n\\nLet me substitute for NO, so what I get is e t is equal to v C3 t right it says this is delta t.\\nSo, e t is equal to c3 t divided by so I have got a patience for e t based on the\\nconcentration at the outlet. Now, the c3 I need to get that in terms of the residence time,\\ninitial concentration or inlet concentration. And I know these are all CSTR, let me write\\n\\nan steady state balance for CSTR.\\n\\x0c(Refer Slide Time: 24:47)\\n\\n \\n\\nCSTR 1 V1 that is a volume of CSTR d cl by dt you learned this unsteady state balance\\nfor CSTR is equal to minus v C1 right. Shall I write here? This is what this is going out\\nthis is going out, this is accumulation coming in Shall I write this? No, because what I\\nam looking at see traces experiment, pulse experiments, I am injecting a tracer. And,\\n\\nthen after that at 0 time an injecting tracer and after then I am observing the response.\\n\\nSo, after that is there anything that is coming in as per as a tracer is concerned no right.\\nSo, I have injected and stopped it now it is only the inlet that is flowing, the solvent that\\nis flowing. The tracer is not coming in, after 0 plus and this is equation I have written is\\nfor time 0 plus onwards let me 0 onwards. So, this term is not there, this term is not\\n\\nthere.\\n\\nSo, I have only this equation for the concentration in the first time I am writing it for a\\nfirst time. Now, later on I will do it first, second, third and then finally, I will get\\nexpressions for c3 that is my objective. So, here from this I get a concentration and outlet\\nof tank 1, where I have the boundary condition at time is equal to 0 time is equal to 0 C1\\n\\nis equal to CO, but solve this equation its very simple right.\\n\\nSo that is nothing but C1 is equal to c0 e raise to minus t by tau 1 what is tau 1? tau 1 is\\nequal to v1 divided by v. This is a volumetric flow rate, this is a volume of first tank this\\n\\nis a expression for C1 that is the concentration and outlet of first tank. So, let us continue\\n\\x0cnow, so this acts as a inlet for a second tank. So, let us a write an expression for the\\n\\nsecond tank.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 27:24)\\n\\n \\n\\nTank number 2 what is it? v2 d c2 by dt is equal to v C1 coming in minus v c2 I cannot\\nneglect this. This is changing with respect to time and 0 plus C1 will have some value.\\nSo, there will be 2 terms as per as tank 2 is concerned, but tank 1 inlet was 0, because\\ntracer was 0 at tank 0 plus right. Before we go ahead let me, make an assumption that v1\\n\\nis equal to v2 is equal to v3 all v’s are equal same V just was simplicity right.\\n\\nLet me say vi, because I am not use v for something and hence later I am not use v for\\nthe total volume let me call this is vi. So, let becomes vi here fine, so let me simplify or\\nother solve this further for C1 I have the expression. What is that? This 1. So, this\\nexpression I will substitute for C1 what I get is this dc2 by dt is plus c2 by now I will\\nsay, tau i. Why tau i.? So, what is tau i? tau i is equal to Vi divided by v which is\\n\\nconstant that is volumetric flow rate given to you.\\n\\nSo, C2 divided by tau i is equal to CO divided by tau i into e raise to minus t by tau il am\\njust substituting for C1 and expressing everything in terms of tau i now. So, you know\\nwhat is tau i? So, I get an expression for differential equation for C2 right now again, for\\nthis I need a boundary condition at t is equal to 0, C2 is equal to 0 right. So, this equation\\n\\nI solve this using this boundary condition, so this is famous or this is a couple of method\\n\\x0cof integrations factor e raise to t by tau i. So, this expression can be solving using\\n\\nintegration factor or integrating factor e base to tau by.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 30:26)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, t by tau i and I get the solution for it; which is given by C2 is equal to CO t divided\\nby t tau i into e raise to minus t by tau i. See concentration and outlet of the second tank\\nis a express in terms of initial concentration time anyway, | want to know how it changes\\nwith time and of course, tau i right. I will eliminated C1 what is my aim? I am my aim is\\n\\nto get C3 in terms of CO t and tau i.\\n\\nSo, let us do it now I follow same methodology for tank 3 substitute for C2, because now\\nin tank 3 in inlet is C2 right and I will solve this equation fine. So, what I get is, C3 is\\nequal to, so you can try it out again a same methodology I get what I get is this e raise to\\nminus t by tau i. So, you have 2 appearing here right see the difference, not much\\ndifference but of course, you have the you have the exponential term there. And, but\\ninstead of t now it becomes t square i have 2 appearing here tau instead of tau i I have tau\\ni square. So, let us go ahead now I have the expression for the e curve or other the e for\\n\\nthe entire reactor that tanks in series.\\n\\x0c(Refer Slide Time: 32:21)\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat is that? This 1 now I have the expression for e, I have the expression for C3;\\n\\nsubstitute this C3 in e curve or other the e expression for e.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 32:40)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, what I get is see final, so see objective is to get e expression for e. So, I substitute for\\nC3 and let me write this first, so that C3 right. Now, what is this? This is the total amount\\nof the tracer that I have injected, can I get it in terms of initial concentration CO? Possible\\n\\nwhat is it?\\n\\x0c(Refer Slide Time: 33:44)\\n\\n \\n\\nIf you look at it what happens at time 0 you have CO is equal to NO; that is a total number\\nof moles or whatever unit can be grams or moles whatever. You have that much amount\\nof tracer divided by V1. So, this is something present at time is equal to 0 sharp in the\\n\\nreactor V1 is a volume and it can be Vi also in our case.\\n\\nSo, let me call this is Vi; which is nothing but the total amount right is VO which is\\nnothing but v rather into C3 t dt right divided by Vi. So, from this what is this v by Vi tau\\n1 by tau. So, this till is tell me that this integration is nothing but tau i into CO right. And\\nI am just expressing it in terms of initial concentration, because this is appearing the final\\n\\nequation right.\\n\\x0c(Refer Slide Time: 35:27)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, let me get back to this equation this is for the e curve I am substituting for C3 that I\\n\\nhave just derived C3 that have derived here.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 35:39)\\n\\n \\n\\nI will substitute it here and then I will have a very simple equation e t is equal to CO CO\\nwill get cancel. And I will have t square divided by 2 tau i now it cubed, because it is 1\\ntau I have just come from that denominator integration term e raise to minus t by tau i.\\nNow, this is for 3 tanks if you applies same logic do it 4 tanks, 5 tanks, 6 tanks, n tanks\\n\\nthen what I am going to get is this is for n tanks is t raise to see 3 tanks 2 here n minus 1\\n\\x0cdivided by see n minus 1 factorial into tau i raise to n see the logic, then e raise to minus\\n\\nt by tau i this is for n tanks in series.\\n\\nSo, I have got an expression for e curve for n tanks in series; a general expression for e\\ncurve for the n tanks in series and that is what I want right. So, when I get e curve I have\\ne curve, so in this is 1 parameter that is n that I can calculate from this. So, this will this\\nwill obtain from experiment in the laboratory for a reactor; it tabular reactor under a flow\\nconditions that are desired for the reaction. But of course, I do the experiment\\n\\nnonreactive condition you know that just look at a residence time distribution right.\\n\\nSo, from this experiment I get e curve from e curve I get n, because I had I have an\\nexpression for tanks in series e curve and once again get n then I can calculate a\\nconversion. What is n? n tells you the extent of back mixing n infinity means, if PFR, n1\\nmeans its CSTR. And in between 1 and infinity you have the extent of back mixing\\ncharacterized by the number n fine. Let’s go ahead and simplified further equation looks\\n\\nbit a complicated.\\n\\nSo, from this you have going to defining a term called a variance of course, you know\\nwhat is variance when we had distribution the variance that means, how much at\\n\\nparticular time in the values of away from the average.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 38:44)\\n\\n \\n\\x0cSo, the something called as variance before that will define a term non-dimensional term\\ntheta equal to t by tau, where tau is that total residence time what is it mean? That means,\\ntau is n into tau i is individual residence time for every tank n into tau i is a total\\nresidence time. So, if tau i is equal to Vi by v then tau is equal to V which is nothing but\\nV1 plus V2 and so on divided by V that why I said now I have been using V for\\n\\nsomething else the total volume.\\n\\nWhy? Because see I do not have tanks, I am just assuming a tubular reactor to be set of\\ntanks. So, all I know is the total volume right, so I need to expression in terms of total\\nvolume finally, right this total volume is V1 plus V2 plus V3 plus V4 and so on. So, the\\nresidence time based on total volume is tau right for individual reactor is what tau i now\\nit is tau. And, then I have a dimension less number theta express in terms of tau that is t\\n\\nby tau.\\n\\nSo, I have the expression for e t I will write it again to raise to n minus 1 divided by n\\nminus 1 factorial tau i n right e raise to minus t by tau i. Now, this will get reduce to e\\ntheta now t will be express in terms of dimension less time theta while do that, then all\\nthese will get converted to n into n theta raise to n minus 1 see t will become n theta.\\nBecause, see t right then e raise to minus n theta divided by n minus 1 factorial. So, this\\nis the expression for e in terms of dimensional less time instead of actual time you going\\n\\nto use this further that why you expressed like that.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 41:50)\\n\\n \\n\\x0cNow, there is a variance that we define now how do we define variance if you have a\\ndistribution the expression for the variance is, in terms of dimensional less time variance\\nsquare is equal to actual variance in time divided by tau square. Now, so this is nothing\\nbut 0 to infinity theta minus 1 square e theta d theta right. I hope it is clear if you write\\njust variance in time you will have t minus tau you have to just divided by tau square and\\n\\nthen you get this.\\n\\nSo, it is a very as I said like how much you go away from tau mean residence time. So, if\\nyou expand this further what you get is 0 to infinity theta square e theta d theta minus 2. I\\nam just expanding this, so theta minus 2 theta plus 1 so you get this. So, what is the value\\nof this? This is equal to 1 this particular term. What about this? This particular term this\\n\\nis dimensionless average residence time dimensionless.\\n\\nSo, it is going to be 1 because it is the reference is tau for the residence time it was t e t\\ndt, then I was tau now it is theta e theta d theta; that means, it is tau divided by tau that\\nmeans, 1. So, this is this is going to be again is integration is going to be 1, this is 1, this\\nis 1. So, minus 2 plus 1 is minus 1 0 theta minus 1, so this is an expression I am going to\\n\\nsimplify this further.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 44:45)\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, let us solve this integration what I get is or before that let me just write it again right\\nsubstitute for e theta see we have derived equation for e theta. So, this is e theta I just\\n\\nsubstitute for it n n theta n minus 1 divided by n minus 1 factorial e raise to minus n theta\\n\\x0cd theta minus 1. Now, if you do all this what you get is, because take n, so will have n\\nraise to n divided by n minus 1 factorial it come out right. And you have 0 infinity theta\\nraise to n plus 1 e raise to minus n theta right dt that is solve this further what you get,\\n\\nyou can do it on your own.\\n\\nSo, it get simplified to very simple term 1 by n and this is what I want variance is 1 by n;\\nvariance is obtained from the e curve. So, once you get variance right you get value of\\nand number of tanks in series. So, n is equal to 1 by sigma theta square which is nothing\\nbut tau square divided by sigma square right. So, I get a value of n this is what I want\\n\\nright.\\n\\nSo, given e curve now will see how to calculate sigma from e curve, I have already told\\nyou that expression for rate. But will solve or I will tell you the procedure to get sigma\\nfrom that or this sigma they from that I get n. So, e curve will give you sigma and sigma\\n\\nwill give you the value of n right.\\n\\n(Refer Slide Time: 47:23)\\n\\n \\n\\nHow to calculate conversion for the given n, now we talking about reactor tank in series\\nthere is very simple know. I have n number of tanks how do I calculate conversion for a\\nCSTR? I have n number of CSTR are in series the conversion say for first order reaction\\nthe conversion is 1 minus 1 by 1 plus tau i k raise to n tau i is the again see do not get\\n\\nconfusion this 2 tau.\\n\\x0cSo, this 2 tau is the residence time for single tank what is k? k is the rate constant. And\\nthis is something like that you done before. So, let me summarize I have a tubular reactor\\nI want to get a convergent problem can be other around for given convergent, find out a\\nlength a volume the tubular reactor, when I have a tubular reactor let us talk about given\\n\\nreactor in calculating convergent.\\n\\nSo, I have a tubular reactor what I will have to? I will not assume it has a PFR. Now we\\nhave talking about, non-ideality that can be possibility of back mixing. So, what I will do\\nis I just pass of fluid I will do residence time distribution experiment. I will inject a tracer\\nlook at its falls it outlet I will get a e curve form it right. Once I have the e curve, then I\\ncan get a variance from the e curve; from the variance I will get a number of tanks in\\nseries for that particular tubular reactors reactor other if it is close to PFR the value of n\\n\\nwill be very large.\\n\\nIf there is so much back mixing happening for some reasons value of n will be close to 1\\n1 2 3 whatever. So, I get a value of n once I know the value of n, I have the expression\\nfor convergent and that tells me how much is the convergent based on n. Because, rest all\\nyou know what is this rate constant; tau i is the residence time for the individual reactor\\n\\nhow do i calculate tau i? So, I know the total volume for the tube.\\n\\nSo, know the total residence time from a total residence time I calculate individual\\nresidence time; residence time individual reactor. But dividing it by n; n is known right.\\nSo, I get an expression for a convergent that is for the first order, but I am of course, for\\nsecond order, third order, but I have different expression it is just solving a problem for\\n\\nCSTR.\\n\\nSo, I have converted a non-ideal reactor to a an ideal reactor problem tanks in series;\\nideal reactor in series. So, that n varies n is the parameter thank you will continue\\ndiscussion will solves a small problem of course, not numerically, but I will tell you the\\n\\nprocedure, so let things will be clear to you fine.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\x0c'"
